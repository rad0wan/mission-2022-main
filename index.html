            <p>My focus in 2022 is to be at least as a junior web developer of my own web development. So I will
                increase my skill little by little every day. And in order to fulfill my goal, I have chosen the
                programming-hero course. InshaAllah I will make myself a junior web developer by completing this course
                to the best of my ability, InsahAllah.</p>
